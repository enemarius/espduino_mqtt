## Boot info
    
    default startup baudrate: 74880 then changes to 115200
    
    Boot modes:

        001*        1           Boot from the data received from UART0. Also
                                includes flashing the flash memory for subsequent
                                normal starts.

        101         5           SDIO high speed V1
        110         6           SDIO low speed V1
        111         7           SDIO high speed V2

        GPIO#15 always LOW 
        GPIO#2  always HIGH
        -----
        GPIO#0 LOW  => boot from UART0, flash memory
        GPIO#0 HIGH => boot from FLASH
    
    Reset codes:
        0 -> normal startup by power on
        1 -> hardware watch dog reset
        2 -> software watch dog reset (From an exception)
        3 -> software watch dog reset system_restart (Possibly unfed wd got angry)
        4 -> soft restart (Possibly with a restart command)
        5 -> wake up from deep-sleep

    Memory map
    
        The reset vector is 40000080h, which maps to internal ROM.

## Arduino IDE setup and use

    https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout/using-arduino-ide
    
    select Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 from the Tools->Board dropdown
    
    80 MHz as the CPU frequency

    115200 baud upload speed

    ### Blink test
    
        ```javascript
        void setup() {
          pinMode(0, OUTPUT);
        }
         
        void loop() {
          digitalWrite(0, HIGH);
          delay(500);
          digitalWrite(0, LOW);
          delay(500);
        }
        ```

    put the board into bootload mode:
        Hold down the GPIO0 button, the red LED will be lit
        While holding down GPIO0, click the RESET button
        Release RESET, then release GPIO0
        When you release the RESET button, the red LED will be lit dimly, this means its ready to bootload
    
    upload the sketch via the IDE
        
    red led should blink(GPIO0)
    
    ### Connect to wifi test
        
        ```javascript
        /*
         *  This sketch demonstrates how to scan WiFi networks. 
         *  The API is almost the same as with the WiFi Shield library, 
         *  the most obvious difference being the different file you need to include:
         */
        #include "ESP8266WiFi.h"

        void setup() {
          Serial.begin(115200);

          // Set WiFi to station mode and disconnect from an AP if it was previously connected
          WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
          WiFi.disconnect();
          delay(100);

          Serial.println("Setup done");
        }

        void loop() {
          Serial.println("scan start");

          // WiFi.scanNetworks will return the number of networks found
          int n = WiFi.scanNetworks();
          Serial.println("scan done");
          if (n == 0)
            Serial.println("no networks found");
          else
          {
            Serial.print(n);
            Serial.println(" networks found");
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            {
              // Print SSID and RSSI for each network found
              Serial.print(i + 1);
              Serial.print(": ");
              Serial.print(WiFi.SSID(i));
              Serial.print(" (");
              Serial.print(WiFi.RSSI(i));
              Serial.print(")");
              Serial.println((WiFi.encryptionType(i) == ENC_TYPE_NONE)?" ":"*");
              delay(10);
            }
          }
          Serial.println("");

          // Wait a bit before scanning again
          delay(5000);
        }
        ```

    - "/"       = topic level separator
    - can contain spaces, not recommended
    - is case sensitive, use lower case only
    - "/" valid topic, root like, don`t use it at start
    - "$" special start character: $SYS/broker/uptime
        - client cannot publish to these topics

    Wildcards:
        - Single level:

    ## QoS
    
        QoS for Publish:    Client --> Broker
            QoS level set by the client for a that sent msg
        Qos for Subscribe   Broker --> Client
            QoS level set by the other client, which has subscribed to broker
            
        - the QoS level can be degraded, if a client subscribes with a lower QoS
          than the one used by the client which published the msg.
    
        0 = at most once
            msg not ACK by receiver(broker)
            msg not stored and redelivered by sender(client)
            "fire and forget"
            same guarantee as the TCP underneath
            
                        PUBLISH QoS 0
            CLIENT -----------------------> BROKER
            
        1 = at least once
            guaranteed the msg is delivered at least once to receiver(broker)
            the message can also be delivered more than once
            the sender stores the message until receives PUBACK from receiver
            
                        PUBLISH QoS 1
            CLIENT -----------------------> BROKER
                        PUBACK
            CLIENT <----------------------- BROKER
            
        2 = exactly once
            guarantees that each message is received only once by the counterpart
            safest and slowest
            PUBREC  = ack message from broker -> the client can discard the copy of the msg
            PUBREL  = ack from client to broker -> the broker can discard any saved state
            PUBCOMP = the flow is complete

                        PUBLISH QoS 2
            CLIENT -----------------------> BROKER
                        PUBREC
            CLIENT <----------------------- BROKER
                        PUBREL
            CLIENT -----------------------> BROKER
                        PUBCOMP
            CLIENT <----------------------- BROKER

        Use QoS 0 when:
            - stable connection, wired network
            - don`t care if some msg are lost sometimes
            - don`t need msg queing, for disconnected clients

        Use QoS 1 when:
            - need the get every msg
            - can handle duplicates
            - you can`t bear the overhead of QoS 2
        
        Use QoS 2 when:
            - you need to receive a msg exactly once

        **Note**:   All msg sent with QoS 1 and 2 will be qued for offline clients,
                    if they subscribed with a "persisten session".

    ### Persistent/Clean session
        
        Use a Persistent session when:
            - a client must get all msg, even if it is offline
            - a client has limited resources and the broker should hold the subscriptions
        
        Use a Clean session when:
            - a client is only publishing to broker, not subscribing
            - a client does not need the msg from when it was offline
